## Print and build your own lamp

This repository contains all the print files and instructions to print and built your own Ninjacat lamp!

### Requirements

- a 3D printer with a build plate of at least 236mm x 236mm (9.3" x 9.3")
- [ESP8266 Wi-Fi microcontroller](https://www.amazon.nl/dp/B01N9RXGHY?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1)
- [WS2812B LED Strip 2m (6.5ft)](https://www.amazon.nl/dp/B0D5B5CGVX?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1)
- Micro-USB cable
- Black and white filament are probably your best choice but feel free to experiment üòâ

### Print Files

| Example | Filename | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![housing](/.images/ninjacat-lamp-printfiles-housing.png) | ninjacat-lamp-housing.stl | This is the lamp's main housing. If you have a multi-material printer (i.e. Bambu Labs with AMS) color the bottom with a white color to increase light reflectivity. If you don't own a multi-material printer, please print the separate 'reflector' and put this inside the housing instead. |
| ![cover](/.images/ninjacat-lamp-printfiles-cover.png) | ninjacat-lamp-cover.stl | This is the cover to put on the front of the housing after LED installation. The 1mm thick front should provide plenty of transparency for the lights to shine through. If you want to print this cover as nicely as possible use the following print settings:<br> - Print face up with **NORMAL** supports<br> - Top interface spacing: 0.3mm<br> - Enable ironing<br> - Ironing speed: 150mm/s<br> - Ironing flow: 38%<br> - Ironing line spacing: 0.15mm<br> - Ironing inset: 0.21mm<br>This will create the most smooth surface for both the top and underside of the cover. |
| ![reflector](/.images/ninjacat-lamp-printfiles-reflector.png) | ninjacat-lamp-housing-reflector.stl | This reflector is optional if you don't own a printer capable of printing multiple materials within the same layer. The reflector fits nice and snug inside the housing and provides maximum light reflectivity. |
| ![espholder](/.images/ninjacat-lamp-printfiles-espholder.png) | ninjacat-lamp-housing-esp8266-holder.stl | This holds the ESP8266 board and should be glued to the backside of the housing/reflector. This ensures the board and cables won't touch the front cover creating ugly shadows from the LEDs. |
| ![eyes](/.images/ninjacat-lamp-printfiles-eyes.png) | ninjacat-lamp-housing-eye-infill.stl | These tiny white cylinders fit inside the cavities of the cat's eyes, part of the housing. |
| ![stand](/.images/ninjacat-lamp-printfiles-stand.png) | ninjacat-lamp-housing-stand.stl | A separate stand if you which to put your Ninjacat on a shelve instead of hanging it on the wall. |
| ![tag](/.images/ninjacat-lamp-printfiles-tag.png) | ninjacat-lamp-housing-stand.stl | This tag was part of the Yellowhat 2025 giveaway, and speaker gifts, and is obviously completely optional. The QR code links to this page for instructions on how to use/setup the lamp. |
| ![tag](/.images/ninjacat-lamp-printfiles-3mf.png) | ninjacat-lamp.3mf | This project file is probably the best way to get started. It uses all the print settings specified above, and it also contains some additional modifier shapes to prevent ironing certain parts which will not stay visible in the assembled state. The last plate shouldn't be printed and is just to provide a visualization of the entire end result. |

### Assembly

1. Glue the ESP holder to the bottom of the housing/reflector. (see images below for placement)
2. Cut off the connector from the start of the LED strip and also remove the separate red and white power wires. We'll only be needing the red, white and green wires.
3. Solder the red (5V), white (G) and green (D4) to the ESP8266 board.
![solder](/.images/ninjacat-lamp-assemble-solder.jpg)
4. Start the LED strip on the bottom right and circle counter-clockwise around the ring to get started. The first LED should be right on the edge:
![led-start](/.images/ninjacat-lamp-assemble-led-start.jpg)
5. Make sure to route the cable underneath the LED strip near the end:
![led-end](/.images/ninjacat-lamp-assemble-led-end.jpg)
6. Cut off the remaining LEDs from the strip. There should be a total of **94** LEDs in use.

![led-route](/.images/ninjacat-lamp-assemble-led-route.png)

> [!NOTE]
> While you could go with a different order for the LED placement, the `ledmap.json` further down this document only works with this exact placement. If you change the order you should also create your own `ledmap.json` or accept that you have to create more than three segments manually.

### Installing WLED firmware

![wled-install](/.images/ninjacat-lamp-wled-install.gif)

1. Connect the USB cable to your computer and open up a browser which supports serial-port emulation (i.e. Microsoft Edge, sorry Safari won't work...)
2. visit [https://install.wled.me](https://install.wled.me) and click on **INSTALL**.
3. A pop-up will open asking you which port to use, select the emulated serial port over USB.
4. Wait until flash is complete and enter your Wi-Fi network credentials.
5. You'll be automatically redirected to the device page.

#### Initial setup

1. Go into "Config" --> "WiFi Setup" and update your hostname (i.e. `ninjacat-lamp.local`) (not required)
2. Go into "Config" --> "LED Preferences" and update both the Max PSU current to **900mA** and Length to **94**:
![ledpreferences](/.images/ninjacat-lamp-wled-ledconfig.jpg)

> [!NOTE]
> Since we'll be powering the LEDs of the ESP8266 board, we're limited to the maximum current the traces on the board are able to handle. The board should be able to handle 1A but since the chip itself is also needing some power we like to stay safe with 900mA.
> There's also a limitation for the maximum current a Micro-USB connection is able to support. So if you want to go max brightness an external power supply is needed. But since we'll only be powering 94 LEDs this should be sufficient.
> If you end up creating complex animations which bright flashes (for example with bright white) you might notice some slight flickering on the LEDs. This is because WLED is automatically bringing back brightness to not exceed the 900mA provided. If this happens, bring back the brightness of segments, thus limiting current which will also eliminates the flickering.

3. Add `/edit` to the device page URL and create a new file named `ledmap.json`.
4. Copy the contents and click "Save".


```json
{
  "map": [
      0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32,
     33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93,
     39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76
  ]
}
```

![wled-install](/.images/ninjacat-lamp-wled-ledmap.png)

> [!NOTE]
> The `ledmap.json` changes the order of your LEDs on the strip. This ensures that we can have three distinct segments for either the "Ring", "Ninjacat" and its "Bandana". Otherwise we would've ended up with multiple segments of each due to the way the entire strip is routed through the housing.

#### Configuring LED segments

The easiest way is to run the PowerShell script `Send-Wledconfig.ps1` from this repository to push the initial setup.

```powershell
./wled/Send-Wledconfig.ps1 -lampAddress ninjacat-lamp.local
```
![wled-pssendconfig](/.images/ninjacat-lamp-wled-pssendconfig.jpg)

But you can also set the segments manually:
![wled-install](/.images/ninjacat-lamp-wled-segments.jpg)

Unfortunately The API doesn't allow for storing presets. So, we have to save the current state as a preset and "apply at boot" if we don't want to loose the current start after a power loss.

## Re-configure Wi-Fi

If your lamp is already fully assembled and was setup earlier, please go through the following steps to re-configure Wi-Fi.

1. Connect the USB cable to your computer and open up a browser which support serial-port emulation (i.e. Microsoft Edge, sorry Safari won't work...)
2. visit [https://install.wled.me](https://install.wled.me) and click on **INSTALL**.
3. A pop-up will open asking you which port to use, select the emulated serial port over USB.
4. Since the device is already flashed with WLED firmware you get an option to change the Wi-Fi configuration.
5. After altering the Wi-Fi configuration you get the option to "visit device" or "add to Home Assistant". The device is accessible via [http://ninjacat-lamp.local](http://ninjacat-lamp.local)
6. Use the device page to create your own unique presets and animations using the pre-defined segments "Ninjcat", "Ring" and "Bandana".
7. There's also a WLED App for iOS and Android to switch/alter your Ninjacat lamp or you can choose to integrate it into Home Assistant.
